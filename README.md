# MusCAT Code Guide

## Components and Methodology

Our solution introduces **_MusCAT_**, a multi-scale federated system
for privacy-preserving pandemic risk prediction. It is implemented in Python and Go.

- Centralized solution uses Python:

  - [solution_centralized.py](solution_centralized.py) represents the entrypoint to the solution. It defines the main functions required by the framework (`fit()` and `predict()`) and implements MusCAT's general workflow, similar to the one described in _Section 3.4 (Privacy-Preserving Federated System for Individual Risk Prediction)_ of our manuscript.

  - [muscat_model.py](muscat_model.py) constructs the MusCAT model and defines each step of MusCAT's workflow (called by [solution_centralized.py](solution_centralized.py)). See _Sections 3.4 and 5.1 (Centralized performance)_ for discussions of the workflow and its benchmarks.

- Federated solution uses both Python and Go. The latter is needed for cryptographic operations, and uses a [custom fork](https://github.com/hcholab/lattigo/tree/petschal) of [Lattigo](https://github.com/tuneinsight/lattigo) library for lattice-based homomorphic encryption, as discussed in _Section 5.2 (Federated Performance → Implementation Details)_.

  - [solution_federated.py](solution_federated.py) represents the entrypoint to the solution. It defines the main functions required by the framework (e.g., `fit()`, `configure_fit()`, ...) and implements MusCAT's general federated workflow.

    - `fit()` in class `TrainClient` implements the core of our model training, executed by the clients, with the computation of global statistics (**W0-W3** in _Section 3.4_) and the Poisson regression (**W4**).
    - `aggregate_fit()` in class `TrainStrategy` defines the operations of the server, i.e., securely aggregating encrypted information for the collaboration among the clients, as described in _Section 5 (Experimental Results)._
    - `fit()` and `evaluate()` in class `TestClient` implement the clients' part of the inference (**W6**)
    - `configure_fit()` and `aggregate_fit()` define the server functions for the same operations. See _Section 5._

  - [muscat_model.py](muscat_model.py) constructs the MusCAT model and defines each step of MusCAT's federated workflow (called by [solution_federated.py](solution_federated.py)), as described in _Section 3.4_.

  - [muscat_privacy.py](muscat_privacy.py) contains static parameters and functions specific for Differential Privacy (DP). See _Sections 3.4, 4 (Privacy Analysis → DP Training),_ and _5.2 (Federated Performance → Privacy)_ for a discussion of DP, its implementation and performance.

  - [dpmean.py](dpmean.py) provides `multivariate_mean_iterative()` that implements CoinPress algorithm for private mean estimation (called by [solution_federated.py](solution_federated.py)), as described in _section 5.2_ _(Federated Performance → Privacy)_.

  - [muscat_workflow.py](muscat_workflow.py) contains static parameters for
    the secure and plaintext training and testing workflows. It notably defines the training parameters and the order of the rounds to train a model. See _Section 3.4_ on the workflow.

  - [mhe_routines.go](mhe_routines.go) represents the Go entrypoint that
    parses command-line arguments passed to it from Python, and executes
    a computation corresponding to its step in the Python workflow.
    This takes the form:

    ```sh
    muscat <command> <arg1> [<arg2> ...]
    ```

    where `<command>` designates a step in the workflow,
    and `<arg1> [<arg2> ...]` represents various arguments, which
    specify either path(s) to the data directory(s), or numeric parameters. It currently enables the setup of the cryptographic parameters and the execution of the _Collective Aggregation and Decryption_ (used during MusCAT's workflow for secure aggregation of the clients' local results by the server), as discussed in _Sections 3.4 and 5_.

  - [mhe/crypto.go](mhe/crypto.go) contains cryptographic utilities
    for Multiparty Homomorphic Encryption (MHE, e.g., vectors encryption and decryption), along with some functions to handle disk I/O (e.g., to save and read cryptographic parameters and keys), which is needed for passing data from/to Python. See Section _5.2.1 (Efficiency & Scalability → MHE Operations)_ on the use of these cryptographic primitives.

  - [mhe/protocols.go](mhe/protocols.go) provides high-level functions
    that implement disk-assisted client-server communication protocol. See _Section 5.2.1 (Efficiency & Scalability)_ for this protocol implementation.

  - [mhe/utilities.go](mhe/utilities.go) contains auxiliary utilities,
    including functions to (de)serialize data vectors and matrices
    from/to disk, in order to pass them from/to Python. See _Section 5.2.1_ for relevant discussions.

  - [go.mod](go.mod) and [go.sum](go.sum) configure third-party Go
    dependencies.

## Running

1. Download and partition the `va-*` data files as described in
   the `pandemic-partitioning-example.ipynb` notebook
   on the [Data Download page](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/103/nist-federated-learning-2-pandemic-forecasting-federated/data/).

2. Install Docker and run the following command:
   ```sh
   export SUBMISSION_TYPE=centralized # or federated
   docker run --rm -it \
     --env SUBMISSION_TRACK=${SUBMISSION_TYPE} \
     --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/data/${SUBMISSION_TYPE},target=/code_execution/data,readonly \
     ghcr.io/hhcho/muscat ${SUBMISSION_TYPE}
   ```

## Local testing/development

```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t muscat .
```
