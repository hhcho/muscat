# U.S. PETs Prize Challenge Phase 2 (Pandemic Forecasting): MusCAT Code Guide

## Components and Methodology

Our solution introduces **_MusCAT_**, a multi-scale federated system
for privacy-preserving pandemic risk prediction. It is implemented in Python and Go.

- Centralized solution uses Python:

  - [solution_centralized.py](solution_centralized.py) represents the entrypoint to the solution. It defines the main functions required by the framework (`fit()` and `predict()`) and implements MusCAT's general workflow, similar to the one described in *Section 3.4 (Privacy-Preserving Federated System for Individual Risk Prediction)* of our manuscript.

  - [muscat_model.py](muscat_model.py) constructs the MusCAT model and defines each step of MusCAT's workflow (called by [solution_centralized.py](solution_centralized.py)). See *Sections 3.4 and 5.1 (Centralized performance)* for discussions of the workflow and its benchmarks.

- Federated solution uses both Python and Go. The latter is needed for cryptographic operations, and uses a [custom fork](https://github.com/hcholab/lattigo/tree/petschal) of [Lattigo](https://github.com/tuneinsight/lattigo) library for lattice-based homomorphic encryption, as discussed in *Section 5.2 (Federated Performance → Implementation Details)*.

  - [solution_federated.py](solution_federated.py) represents the entrypoint to the solution. It defines the main functions required by the framework (e.g., `fit()`, `configure_fit()`, ...) and implements MusCAT's general federated workflow.
      - `fit()` in class `TrainClient` implements the core of our model training, executed by the clients, with the computation of global statistics (**W0-W3** in *Section 3.4*) and the Poisson regression (**W4**).
      - `aggregate_fit()` in class `TrainStrategy` defines the operations of the server, i.e., securely aggregating encrypted information for the collaboration among the clients, as described in *Section 5 (Experimental Results → Model & Algorithmic modifications ...).*
      - `fit()` and `evaluate()` in class `TestClient` implement the clients' part of the inference (**W6**)
      - `configure_fit()` and `aggregate_fit()` define the server functions for the same operations. See *Section 5 (Experimental Results → Model & Algorithmic modifications ...).*

  - [muscat_model.py](muscat_model.py) constructs the MusCAT model and defines each step of MusCAT's federated workflow (called by [solution_federated.py](solution_federated.py)), as described in *Section 3.4*.

  - [muscat_privacy.py](muscat_privacy.py) contains static parameters and functions specific for Differential Privacy (DP). See *Sections 3.4, 4 (Privacy Analysis → Differential Privacy. Training), 5 (Experimental Results → Differentially Private Training),* and *5.2 (Federated Performance → Privacy)* for a discussion of DP, its implementation and performance.

  - [dpmean.py](dpmean.py) provides `multivariate_mean_iterative()` that implements CoinPress algorithm for private mean estimation (called by [solution_federated.py](solution_federated.py)), as described in *section 5.2* *(Federated Performance → Privacy)*.

  - [muscat_workflow.py](muscat_workflow.py) contains static parameters for
    the secure and plaintext training and testing workflows. It notably defines the training parameters and the order of the rounds to train a model. See *Section 3.4* on the workflow.

  - [mhe_routines.go](mhe_routines.go) represents the Go entrypoint that
    parses command-line arguments passed to it from Python, and executes
    a computation corresponding to its step in the Python workflow.
    This takes the form:

    ```sh
    petchal <command> <arg1> [<arg2> ...]
    ```

    where `<command>` designates a step in the workflow,
    and `<arg1> [<arg2> ...]` represents various arguments, which
    specify either path(s) to the data directory(s), or numeric parameters. It currently enables the setup of the cryptographic parameters and the execution of the *Collective Aggregation and Decryption* (used during MusCAT's workflow for secure aggregation of the clients' local results by the server), as discussed in *Sections 3.4 and 5 (Experimental Results → Model & Algorithmic modifications ...)*.

  - [mhe/crypto.go](mhe/crypto.go) contains cryptographic utilities
    for Multiparty Homomorphic Encryption (MHE, e.g., vectors encryption and decryption), along with some functions to handle disk I/O (e.g., to save and read cryptographic parameters and keys), which is needed for passing data from/to Python. See Section *5.2.1 (Efficiency & Scalability → MHE Operations)* on the use of these cryptographic primitives.

  - [mhe/protocols.go](mhe/protocols.go) provides high-level functions
    that implement disk-assisted client-server communication protocol. See *Sections 5.2.1 (Efficiency & Scalability) for this protocol implementation.

  - [mhe/utilities.go](mhe/utilities.go) contains auxiliary utilities,
    including functions to (de)serialize data vectors and matrices
    from/to disk, in order to pass them from/to Python. See *Sections 5.2.1 and 6* for relevant discussions.

  - [go.mod](go.mod) and [go.sum](go.sum) configure third-party Go
    dependencies.

## Building

Our solution incorporates both Python and Go source code, along with the Go binary named `petchal`, which is pre-compiled from this code.

We suggest that this solution is executed as-is with these files, to ensure it works as tested in lab conditions.

### Rebuilding Go code

If you would rather like to reproduce the binary from Go code, you can do so using either:

- `go build` command, if you are on a **Linux** system with **Go 1.19** installed

- `docker run --rm -t --platform linux/amd64 -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work golang:1.19 go build`
  if you are on **macOS**, to ensure binary compatibility with the runtime Linux environment

### Local testing/development

The following instructions are _only_ needed for local testing/development,
and to (re)generate `submission.zip`:

- Clone the challenge repository:

  ```sh
  cd $(mktemp -d) # use a temporary (or an empty) directory
  git clone https://github.com/drivendataorg/pets-prize-challenge-runtime .
  ```

- Download and partition the `va-*` data files as described in
  the `pandemic-partitioning-example.ipynb` notebook
  on the [Data Download page](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/103/nist-federated-learning-2-pandemic-forecasting-federated/data/).

- Build and test a submission:

  ```sh
  # Download the official challenge Docker image
  make pull

  # Prepare runtime variables
  export CPU_OR_GPU=cpu
  export SUBMISSION_TRACK=pandemic
  export SUBMISSION_TYPE=centralized # or federated

  # Inject Docker resource limits to simulate the evaluation environment
  export GPU_ARGS="--cpus=6 --memory=56g"

  # (Re)build the Go code directly, if you're on a Linux system with Go 1.19 installed
  ( cd "submission_src/pandemic" &&  go build )

  # Alternatively, (re)generate the x86_64/amd64 binary if you're on macOS (with or without Apple Silicon)
  docker run --rm -t --platform linux/amd64 \
    -v "$PWD/submission_src/pandemic:/work" \
    -w /work golang:1.19 go build

  # Remove any previous submission archive
  rm -f submission/submission.zip

  # (Re)pack the submission code
  make pack-submission

  # Test the submission
  make test-submission
  ```
